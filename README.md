# RESUMI: Your Portfolio

**Version 1.1.2**

**Description:** Resumi is a mobile application that allows students to organize their high school career. Students can record their extracurricular activities throughout high school such as clubs, non-profit organizations, sports, volunteering, etc. Students can also organize the courses they have taken and the grades they received, which will be automatically processed into grade point average (GPA) and other necessary statistics. Finally, the students can export these information in a form of resume that can be shared to the dominant social media platforms like instagram and facebook. Thank you for choosing Resumi!

**App Architecture:** Resumi is built upon the React Native framework, so the application is available on both Android and IOS platform. Resumi uses Amazon's AWS Amplify for user authentication and database management. Therefore, internet connection is necessary for the proper running of the app. 

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Install the Project Resources

Clone the proejct using the following command line in your appropriate terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishSubra/Resumi.git
```

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
